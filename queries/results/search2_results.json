Ours is beginning to\nemerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the\nimmediate future,\" he told journalists.\n    Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export\npolicy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.\n    Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when\nproblems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks\nhave been resolved.\n    Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying\nIndonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to\nsuggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the\nBrazilian stand was quite clear.\n    He said Brazil's current quota \"reflects the reality of the\nmarket, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,\" but\nadded more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that\ndetermined it.\n    Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure\nof the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among\ndealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers\nwould go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,\nwhich did not happen.\n Reuter\n@0@3;",

A majority of producers wanted\nquotas to continue under this basic scheme.\n    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers\nproposed carving up the export market on the basis of\nexportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's\nshare to 28.8 pct.\n    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes\nin many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more\nreadily available to consumers when they need it.\n    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest\nexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim\nproposal could not bring the two sides together.\n    Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,\nillustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on\nbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to\nprotect its coffee export earnings.\n    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily\non coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and\nColombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure\nto agree quotas, analysts said.\n    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as\nmuch as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates\nforecast.\n    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full\ncouncil is not due to meet again until September, delegates\nsaid.\n REUTER\n@0@3;",

Futures\nbounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading\nrange around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market\nrecovered from yesterday's \"confidence blip,\" one trader\ncommented.\n    But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower\nprices in the near future, one trade source said.\n    The market had become increasingly vulnerable to\nyesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg\nsecond position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he\nsaid.\n    Technically the market is more likely to decline further as\nit absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the\n1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a \"three figure mentality,\" and\nspeculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the\npsychological 1,000 stg level, he added.\n    Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to\nBrazil's opening last night of May green coffee export\nregistrations.\n     This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as\nno surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and\nlight trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.\n    However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of\nsupport at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only\npossible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach\nof Brazil's frost season, they said.\n    Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting\nactivities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not\ntaking up producer offers, they added.\n    Central American producers have sold the bulk of their\ncurrent crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and\nIndonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,\nand this could pressure prices further, traders said.\n    However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be\nbullish, advised caution. \"Everybody's bearish now, just as they\nwere bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg,\" he said.\n    Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed\ndoubts the price spiral would continue much below current\nlevels. \"One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --\nthere must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall.\"\n    While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September\n1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail\nprices.\n    \"Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that\nat this stage,\" a General Foods spokesman said.\n    Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in\nresponse to market weakness. At the beginning of March the\nprice of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65\nstg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to\nfall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.\n    Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in\nthe near future.\n    \"The market seems to have established some equilibrium and\ndoesn't look set to go much lower,\" a Nestle spokesman\ncommented.\n    Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which\nfell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per\nkilo for medium quality, traders added.\n Reuter\n@0@3;",

                "BODY" : "Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream,\nDijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the\nsupermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz\nfor national-brand \"gourmet\" coffees.\n    General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and\nP, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the\nonly two national brand roasters so far to introduce the\nhigher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.\n    But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth\npotential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in\nregular ground roast types.\n    \"I would suspect General Foods will make a name for\nthemselves with their gourmet line,\" said a coffee trade\nsource. \"What it could do is really dent the small-store,\nwhole-bean business,\" the trade source added.\n    The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic\nadvertising composite--the \"yuppie\" consumer.\n    They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and\nwere \"first on their block with a wok,\" as described by Karin\nBrown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,\ncalled Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.\n    Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods\nsubsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described\nits potential appeal as \"a status thing.\"\n    At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is\nexpensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in\nsmall specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has\njust cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs\nfor 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,\naccording to an A and P executive.\n    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has \"nothing to announce at\nthis point\" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does\nHills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and\nfourth size market spot by volume with A and P.\n    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of\nGeneral Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market\ntakes off.\n    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help\npush coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in\nthe United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a\n1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show\nno signs of picking up.\n    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee\nquality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.\n    \"The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name\nof profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this\nwas quality coffee,\" Gallant said.\n    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the\nbrew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, \"they turn\naround and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a\nCoke',\" he said.\n    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have\nconfirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are\naiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd\n-- the yuppie composite.\n    \"Where else are you going to go?,\" an industry source said.\n\"Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are\nno other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is\ngourmet,\" he said.\n    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet\nline could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular\nground roast coffees produce.\n    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of\ngreen, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of\nroasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting\noften-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell\ncoffee near the trade price as a \"loss leader,\" a product\ndesigned to draw shoppers into the store.\n    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing\nstructure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade\ndiscounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a\nspecial valve designed to keep the beans fresher.\n    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green\nbeans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet\ncoffee are now almost three times the price of green.\n    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.\nGeneral Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market\nsurveys for Private Collection came back for more.\n    And product manager Brown points to the success of more\nexpensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in\nrestricted high income areas and are now available in almost\nevery supermarket in the country.\n    A and P is similarly optimistic. \"We think we'll do\nextremely well in the gourmet market,\" Gallant said.\n    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private\nCollection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers\nits 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock\nRoyale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,\nNew York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.\n Reuter\n@0@3;",

Ours is beginning to\nemerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the\nimmediate future,\" he told journalists.\n    Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export\npolicy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.\n    Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when\nproblems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks\nhave been resolved.\n    Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying\nIndonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to\nsuggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the\nBrazilian stand was quite clear.\n    He said Brazil's current quota \"reflects the reality of the\nmarket, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,\" but\nadded more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that\ndetermined it.\n    Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure\nof the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among\ndealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers\nwould go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,\nwhich did not happen.\n Reuter\n@0@3;",

A majority of producers wanted\nquotas to continue under this basic scheme.\n    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers\nproposed carving up the export market on the basis of\nexportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's\nshare to 28.8 pct.\n    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes\nin many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more\nreadily available to consumers when they need it.\n    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest\nexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim\nproposal could not bring the two sides together.\n    Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,\nillustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on\nbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to\nprotect its coffee export earnings.\n    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily\non coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and\nColombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure\nto agree quotas, analysts said.\n    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as\nmuch as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates\nforecast.\n    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full\ncouncil is not due to meet again until September, delegates\nsaid.\n REUTER\n@0@3;",

Futures\nbounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading\nrange around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market\nrecovered from yesterday's \"confidence blip,\" one trader\ncommented.\n    But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower\nprices in the near future, one trade source said.\n    The market had become increasingly vulnerable to\nyesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg\nsecond position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he\nsaid.\n    Technically the market is more likely to decline further as\nit absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the\n1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a \"three figure mentality,\" and\nspeculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the\npsychological 1,000 stg level, he added.\n    Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to\nBrazil's opening last night of May green coffee export\nregistrations.\n     This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as\nno surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and\nlight trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.\n    However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of\nsupport at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only\npossible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach\nof Brazil's frost season, they said.\n    Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting\nactivities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not\ntaking up producer offers, they added.\n    Central American producers have sold the bulk of their\ncurrent crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and\nIndonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,\nand this could pressure prices further, traders said.\n    However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be\nbullish, advised caution. \"Everybody's bearish now, just as they\nwere bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg,\" he said.\n    Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed\ndoubts the price spiral would continue much below current\nlevels. \"One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --\nthere must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall.\"\n    While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September\n1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail\nprices.\n    \"Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that\nat this stage,\" a General Foods spokesman said.\n    Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in\nresponse to market weakness. At the beginning of March the\nprice of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65\nstg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to\nfall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.\n    Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in\nthe near future.\n    \"The market seems to have established some equilibrium and\ndoesn't look set to go much lower,\" a Nestle spokesman\ncommented.\n    Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which\nfell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per\nkilo for medium quality, traders added.\n Reuter\n@0@3;",

                "BODY" : "Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing\nBoard (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two\nmonths due to a bottleneck in export shipments and\nadministrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.\n    The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the\nequivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and\nprocessors for coffee already delivered, but its present export\nrevenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.\n    The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the\neconomy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of\nUganda's total exports.\n    The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January\nfollowing delays in rail-freighting export consignments of\ncoffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.\n    These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in\nUganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan\nwagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and\nTanzanian railway systems, the sources said\n    Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly\nacknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to\nlocal suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for\nmoving exports.\n    Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze\nwould be resolved in two weeks.\n    However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between\nthe Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out\nof action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh\ndelays in cargo movements.\n    Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption\nof rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned\ntheir haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.\n    Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB\nwas holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.\n    These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's\nexpected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September)\ncrop, the sources said.\n    According to the sources, the board's financial problems\nhave been aggravated by long delays in processing export\nreceipts.\n    The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle\nexport receipts into payments to local producers, whereas\nexport bills handled by local banks took half that time to\nprocess, they said.\n    The sources said the CMB's price structure had been\novertaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially\nestimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further\ndisincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.\n    \"The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months\nbehind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the\nsooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the\nbetter for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,\" one\nof the sources said.\n    The government is currently negotiating a package of\neconomic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary\nFund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to\nhelp Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of political\nstrife.\n REUTER\n@0@3;",

                "BODY" : "Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream,\nDijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the\nsupermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz\nfor national-brand \"gourmet\" coffees.\n    General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and\nP, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the\nonly two national brand roasters so far to introduce the\nhigher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.\n    But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth\npotential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in\nregular ground roast types.\n    \"I would suspect General Foods will make a name for\nthemselves with their gourmet line,\" said a coffee trade\nsource. \"What it could do is really dent the small-store,\nwhole-bean business,\" the trade source added.\n    The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic\nadvertising composite--the \"yuppie\" consumer.\n    They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and\nwere \"first on their block with a wok,\" as described by Karin\nBrown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,\ncalled Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.\n    Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods\nsubsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described\nits potential appeal as \"a status thing.\"\n    At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is\nexpensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in\nsmall specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has\njust cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs\nfor 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,\naccording to an A and P executive.\n    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has \"nothing to announce at\nthis point\" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does\nHills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and\nfourth size market spot by volume with A and P.\n    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of\nGeneral Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market\ntakes off.\n    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help\npush coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in\nthe United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a\n1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show\nno signs of picking up.\n    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee\nquality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.\n    \"The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name\nof profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this\nwas quality coffee,\" Gallant said.\n    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the\nbrew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, \"they turn\naround and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a\nCoke',\" he said.\n    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have\nconfirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are\naiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd\n-- the yuppie composite.\n    \"Where else are you going to go?,\" an industry source said.\n\"Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are\nno other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is\ngourmet,\" he said.\n    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet\nline could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular\nground roast coffees produce.\n    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of\ngreen, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of\nroasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting\noften-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell\ncoffee near the trade price as a \"loss leader,\" a product\ndesigned to draw shoppers into the store.\n    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing\nstructure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade\ndiscounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a\nspecial valve designed to keep the beans fresher.\n    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green\nbeans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet\ncoffee are now almost three times the price of green.\n    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.\nGeneral Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market\nsurveys for Private Collection came back for more.\n    And product manager Brown points to the success of more\nexpensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in\nrestricted high income areas and are now available in almost\nevery supermarket in the country.\n    A and P is similarly optimistic. \"We think we'll do\nextremely well in the gourmet market,\" Gallant said.\n    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private\nCollection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers\nits 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock\nRoyale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,\nNew York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.\n Reuter\n@0@3;",

Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both\nrefusing to alter their positions.\n    Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed\nIndonesia was well placed to survive low prices.\n    Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the\nAICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.\n    Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,\nis expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level\nof 360,000 tonnes, he said.\n    He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for\nthe time of year.\n REUTER\n@0@3;",
